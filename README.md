# Simple_3D_Mouse_Example
This project provides the bare minimum example of getting input from a 3D Connexions 3D Mouse,

This will hopefully support all products from 3D COnnexions.

Written with the low-level (oldest) Windows API so no MFC, .NET, AFCetc required just the plain old windows API.

Happy for this to be used commercially but please credit me if you've copied code.
